abstract="Target Set Selection, which is a prominent NP-hard problem occurring in social network analysis and distributed computing, is notoriously hard both in terms of achieving useful polynomial-time approximation as well as fixed-parameter algorithms. Given an undirected graph, the task is to select a minimum number of vertices into a ``target set'' such that all other vertices will become active in the course of a dynamic process (which may go through several activation rounds). A vertex, equipped with a threshold valuet, becomes active once at leastt of its neighbors are active; initially, only the target set vertices are active. We contribute further insights into the existence of islands of tractability for Target Set Selection by spotting new parameterizations characterizing some sparse graphs as well as some ``cliquish'' graphs and developing corresponding fixed-parameter tractability and (parameterized) hardness results. In particular, we demonstrate that upper-bounding the thresholds by a constant may significantly alleviate the search for efficiently solvable, but still meaningful special cases of Target Set Selection.",

abstract="We study the NP-hard Target Set Selection (TSS) problem occurring in social network analysis. Roughly speaking, given a graph where each vertex is associated with a threshold, in TSS the task is to select a minimum-size ``target set'' such that all vertices of the graph get activated. Activation is a dynamic process. First, only the vertices in the target set are active. Then, a vertex becomes active if the number of its active neighbors exceeds its threshold, and so on. TSS models the spread of information, infections, and influence in networks. Complementing results on its polynomial-time approximability and extending results for its restriction to trees and bounded treewidth graphs, we classify the influence of the parameters ``diameter'', ``cluster editing number'', ``vertex cover number'', and ``feedback edge set number'' of the underlying graph on the problem's computational complexity, revealing both tractable and intractable cases. For instance, even for diameter-two split graphs TSS remains W[2]-hard with respect to the parameter ``size of the target set''. TSS can be efficiently solved on graphs with small feedback edge set number and also turns out to be fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the vertex cover number. Both results contrast known parameterized intractability results for the parameter ``treewidth''. While these tractability results are relevant for sparse networks, we also show efficient fixed-parameter algorithms for the parameter ``cluster editing number'', yielding tractability for certain dense networks.",

abstract = "We consider two graph optimization problems called vector domination and total vector domination. In vector domination one seeks a small subset S of vertices of a graph such that any vertex outside S has a prescribed number of neighbors in S. In total vector domination, the requirement is extended to all vertices of the graph. We prove that these problems (and several variants thereof) cannot be approximated to within a factor of clnn, where c is a suitable constant and n is the number of the vertices, unless P=NP. We also show that two natural greedy strategies have approximation factors lnΔ+O(1), where Δ is the maximum degree of the input graph. We also provide exact polynomial time algorithms for several classes of graphs. Our results extend, improve, and unify several results previously known in the literature."

For a fixed positive integer k, the k-tuple domination problem is to find a minimum sized vertex subset in a graph such that every vertex in the graph is dominated by at least k vertices in this set. The current paper studies k-tuple domination in graphs from an algorithmic point of view. In particular, we give a linear-time algorithm for the k-tuple domination problem in strongly chordal graphs, which is a subclass of chordal graphs and includes trees, block graphs, interval graphs and directed path graphs. We also prove that the k-tuple domination problem is NP-complete for split graphs (a subclass of chordal graphs) and for bipartite graphs."

A subset of vertices D is said to be a dynamic monopoly corresponding to (G,τ) if the vertices of G can be partitioned into subsets D0,D1,…,Dk such that D0=D and for any i∈{0,…,k−1}, each vertex v in Di+1 has at least τ(v) neighbors in D0∪…∪Di. Dynamic monopolies are in fact modeling the irreversible spread of influence in social networks. In this paper we first obtain a lower bound for the smallest size of any dynamic monopoly in terms of the average threshold and the order of graph. Also we obtain an upper bound in terms of the minimum vertex cover of graphs. Then we derive the upper bound |G|/2 for the smallest size of any dynamic monopoly when the graph G contains at least one odd vertex, where the threshold of any vertex v is set as ⌈(deg(v)+1)/2⌉ (i.e. strict majority threshold). This bound improves the best known bound for strict majority threshold. We show that the latter bound can be achieved by a polynomial time algorithm. We also show that α′(G)+1 is an upper bound for the size of strict majority dynamic monopoly, where α′(G) stands for the matching number of G. Finally, we obtain a basic upper bound for the smallest size of any dynamic monopoly, in terms of the average threshold and vertex degrees. Using this bound we derive some other upper bounds."

We prove a strong relationship between this convexity and the well known geodesic convexity, which implies several NP-hardness results for the latter. In order to show that, we prove that the hull number for the P3-convexity is NP-hard even for subgraphs of grids and that the convexity number for the P3-convexity is NP-hard even for bipartite graphs with diameter 3. We also obtain linear time algorithms to determine those parameters for the above mentioned convexities for cographs and P4-sparse graphs."

abstract = "The adoption of everyday decisions in public affairs, fashion, movie-going, and consumer behavior is now thoroughly believed to migrate in a population through an influential network. The same diffusion process when being imitated by intention is called viral marketing. This process can be modeled by a (directed) graph G=(V,E) with a threshold t(v) for every vertex v∈V, where v becomes active once at least t(v) of its (in-)neighbors are already active. A Perfect Target Set is a set of vertices whose activation will eventually activate the entire graph, and the Perfect Target Set Selection Problem (PTSS) asks for the minimum such initial set. It is known (Chen (2008) [6]) that PTSS is hard to approximate, even for some special cases such as bounded-degree graphs, or majority thresholds. We propose a combinatorial model for this dynamic activation process, and use it to represent PTSS and its variants by linear integer programs. This allows one to use standard integer programming solvers for solving small-size PTSS instances. We also show combinatorial lower and upper bounds on the size of the minimum Perfect Target Set. Our upper bound implies that there are always Perfect Target Sets of size at most |V|/2 and 2|V|/3 under majority and strict majority thresholds, respectively, both in directed and undirected graphs. This improves the bounds of 0.727|V| and 0.7732|V| found recently by Chang and Lyuu (2010) [5] for majority and strict majority thresholds in directed graphs, and matches their bound under majority thresholds in undirected graphs. Furthermore, our proof is much simpler, and we observe that some of these bounds are tight. One interesting and perhaps surprising implication of our lower bound for undirected graphs, is that it is easy to get a constant factor approximation for PTSS for “relatively balanced” graphs (e.g., bounded-degree graphs, nearly regular graphs) with a “more than majority” threshold (that is, t(v)=ϑ⋅deg(v), for every v∈V and some constant ϑ>1/2), whereas no polylogarithmic approximation exists for “more than majority” graphs."
